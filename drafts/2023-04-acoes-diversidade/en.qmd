::: callout-note
This is a **draft** post, written to be published in the R-Ladies Global blog. This was a suggestion from Yanina Bellini Saibene, one of the R-Ladies Global organizers.
:::


## **Introduction**

The R-Ladies is a global organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. R-Ladies São Paulo proudly is a chapter of R-Ladies Global, promoting gender diversity in the R community in São Paulo, Brazil.

In this post, our goal is to discuss diversity issues currently in the R-Ladies São Paulo community and the actions that are being taken to increase diversity.

To do so, two points are important to be discussed: the concept of intersectionality and issues related to the Brazilian context.

## **Actions taken to increase diversity**

The questionnaire conducted in 2020, and the discussions established above, point to the need for a collective effort by the community to increase diversity.

In order to achieve that, some actions have been taken and will be briefly commented on below. In posts related to recent events, the activities were described in greater detail, for example:

-   [Event: Open Data Analysis with R](https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-03-evento-open-data-day/english.html)

-   [Event: Introduction to R Workshop](https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-01-evento-oficina-intro-R/)

\
**Affirmative actions**

In the sense of promoting diversity in the participation in the events, we saved the spots thinking about three groups (quotas):

-   black, brown and indigenous people;

-   mothers;

-   women and other gender minorities.

The quotas are also advertised on the community's social networks (mainly Instagram), in order to make it clear that the presence of these groups is welcome.\

### Space for children and babies

GuGuDaDados (free translation GuguDadata) is a collaborative and experimental space that RLadies São Paulo proposes with the aim of keeping children entertained and cared for while their mothers/fathers/caretakes can participate in community activities.

With financial support from other organizations, we hired a recreational teacher to accompany the children in the Gugudadados space (a room next to the R-Ladies activities room, on the same floor) throughout the activity. The organizers of R-Ladies also take toys, drawings, markers, games and temporary tattoos to entertain and amuse the children.\

### **Potluck: Collaborative Coffee**

The collaborative coffee is set up with items purchased with the financial support of other organizations, as well as with items brought by participants (a potluck). Thus, people can eat at any time during the event. This coffee format (available all the time during the event) is very good for three reasons: (i) it is a great opportunity to meet and talk to people in the community; (ii) it welcomes participants who, due to health issues, cannot go many hours without eating; and (iii) it welcomes participants who, due to socio-economic conditions, cannot afford to have a meal during the lunch break. Given the nature of the R-Ladies community, it is important to provide a minimum level of support to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the event experience regardless of whether they have something to eat during the day. In addition, the collaborative coffee is also a way to encourage integration among people!

### **Working in pairs**

Not all the participants have a laptop to take to the activity. We hope that everyone can participate regardless of financial condition. Therefore, in publicizing, we encourage people to participate regardless of being able to bring a computer. So, in cases where this happens, we encourage people to form pairs and work together during the event.

### **Encourage carpooling**

The city of São Paulo is very large, and depending on where you need to go, it is common to take 2 hours (or more!) in public transport to move around. Therefore, one of the difficulties of participating in a in-person event is mobility. To ease this difficulty we encourage people that are driving, at the end of the event, to offer rides to people who live in nearby regions of the city. It is still necessary to improve this incentive to combine, in a safe way for all people, rides before the event (and not just at the end).

## **Next steps**

Based on the answers in the questionnaire and the community experience over time, the following actions are necessary:

1.  Offer assistance (such as transportation and food) to allow people with limited financial resources to participate and make the most of events;

2.  Encourage the participation of people who belong to any social minority through quotas, an internal stance of positive discrimination; including these people in the organization; inviting them to offer lectures/workshops; promoting visibility; and giving space for these individuals to bring their perspective, experience, and perception to the ongoing structuring of the R-Ladies São Paulo community.

3.  Search for partnerships in peripheral regions to be able to hold events in those areas, making it easier for people who live far from the city center to attend.\

## **Current organizing team**

\
There are several people currently involved in the organization of the R-Ladies São Paulo community. It is important to mention that the community organizers belong to different minority groups (such as Black women, mothers, trans people, non-binary people, LGBTQIA+, and people over 40 years), and this is important to offer different perspectives and experiences. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the participation in the organization is voluntary. Therefore, we list and thank the people who are involved in the various stages of organizing the community:

-   Ana Paula Rocha

-   Angélica Custódio

-   Ana Carolina Moreno

-   Beatriz Milz

-   Fernanda Peres 

-   Geovana Lopes

-   Haydée Svab

-   Ianní Muliterno

-   Jean Prado

-   Nathália Demétrio 

-   Tatyane Paz
