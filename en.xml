<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rladies.org/">R-Ladies</a> is a global organization that promotes gender diversity in the R community. <a href="https://www.rladies-sp.org/">R-Ladies São Paulo</a> is proudly a chapter of R-Ladies Global, promoting gender diversity in the R community in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>In this post, our goal is to discuss diversity issues in the R-Ladies São Paulo community and the <strong>actions that are being taken to increase diversity</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>This post was written in April/2023. Since that time, <strong>R-Ladies São Paulo received a grant from <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals#Rstats">R Consortium</a></strong>, which allowed the community to expand the actions to increase diversity.</p>

</div>
<p>To do so, two points are important to be discussed: what is intersectionality, and the Brazilian context.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-intersectionality" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-intersectionality">What is intersectionality?</h2>
<p>The target audience of R-Ladies is gender minorities: cis women, trans women, trans men, non-binary people, and queer people. The main purpose of the community is to include these minority groups in the R community. However, for each of these groups, there are people who are part of other groups that may also suffer other oppressions arising from social markers of difference, such as race, sexual orientation, maternity, disabilities, age, etc. Therefore, the oppressions are not just based on a person’s gender, but are interrelated and overlapping. This understanding is a concept called “intersectionality”.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.womankind.org.uk/intersectionality-101-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-important/">Bridie Taylor (2019)</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Intersectionality is the acknowledgment that <strong>everyone has their own unique experiences of discrimination and oppression</strong> and we must consider everything and anything that can marginalize people – gender, race, social class, sexual orientation, physical ability, etc.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a simple example that can illustrate this concept: imagine a White cisgender woman and a Black cisgender woman. Both suffer gender oppression, but only the Black woman experiences racism. Now, consider a cisgender, Black, bisexual woman with atypical children. Even though the first and the last suffer gender oppression, there is no doubt that the last one always has longer and harder ways to reach the same positions.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to consider the issue of gender diversity, but not limit it to gender issues. It is also important to consider in the community’s activities the intersections that the participants are included in, seeking improvement of diversity in several aspects.</p>
</section>
<section id="brazilian-context" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brazilian-context">Brazilian context</h2>
<p>For historical reasons, Brazil is a country that presents different racial compositions depending on the region. The city of São Paulo is located in the Southeast region, where 50.7% of the population declare themselves as White, 38.7% as “Pardo” in free translation “Brown”, which in Brazil is equivalent to Black people of light skin, and 9.6% as “Black” what in Brazil is equivalent to Black people of dark skin (<a href="https://educa.ibge.gov.br/jovens/conheca-o-brasil/populacao/18319-cor-ou-raca.html">based on IBGE - Continuous National Household Sample Survey, referent to 2021</a><sup>1</sup>). Considering that the Black population is composed of “Browns” and “Blacks”, almost half of the population in the Southeast region is Black.</p>
<p>Despite representing about half of the region’s population, the Black population has been marginalized. They are still underrepresented in spaces of power, such as politics, higher education, decision-making positions in companies, etc.</p>
<p><img src="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-06-05-increasing-diversity-sao-paulo/ibge.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Infographic by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, translated by the authors, showing the percentages of the population by color/race in Brazil."> Source: <a href="https://educa.ibge.gov.br/jovens/conheca-o-brasil/populacao/18319-cor-ou-raca.html">IBGE - Continuous National Household Sample Survey, 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Another relevant issue to understand the Brazilian context and the results presented here is the high level of violence with LGBTQIA+ groups, especially transgender people. The results of the <a href="https://transrespect.org/en/trans-murder-monitoring/tmm-resources/">Trans Murder Monitoring (TMM) study in 2022</a> can be seen in the map below: Brazil is the country with the highest absolute values of murders of transgender people since the beginning of the historical series obtained by the TMM.</p>
<p><img src="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-06-05-increasing-diversity-sao-paulo/tmm2022.png" class="img-fluid" alt="World map with results from the Trans Murder Monitoring in 2022: Brazil is the country with the highest number of murders, followed by México."> Source: <a href="https://transrespect.org/en/map/trans-murder-monitoring/?submap=tmm_2022">Trans Murder Monitoring (TMM) - 2022</a></p>
<p>The topic of work and financial income is also particularly sensitive for the trans population. According to the mapping of transgender people, in the city of São Paulo<sup>2</sup> in 2020, approximately half of the people interviewed left home between the ages of 16 and 20, and of these, 30% were due to fights, and 17% were expelled from home. This early exit of their homes impacts trans population access to labor and income: 57% of the interviewees do not have any technical or specific training and 42% were not carrying out any paid activity during the interview period.</p>
<p>These characteristics of the Brazilian population are important to consider when analyzing the diversity of participants in the community.</p>
</section>
<section id="community-survey---2020" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-survey---2020">Community Survey - 2020</h2>
<p>In 2020, we applied an online survey to community members, with the aim of learning more about the composition of our community and how we could increase its diversity. The questionnaire was released in our online groups, such as Meetup and Telegram, and received 161 valid responses.</p>
<p>Below, we will highlight some points raised by the questionnaire responses, addressing topics such as gender diversity, racial diversity, the inclusion of mothers/fathers/caregivers, the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people, food supply, and geographic access. These graphs are important to understand the composition of the community in 2020 and what actions we should take to increase diversity in underrepresented groups.</p>
<section id="gender-diversity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gender-diversity">Gender diversity</h3>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-06-05-increasing-diversity-sao-paulo/2020-gender.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Bar chart where the X axis shows the percentage of respondents of the survey, and the Y axis represents the gender. Around 93% of the respondents said that they are a cis or transgender woman; around 3% said they are a cis or transgender men; and around 3% said that they are non-binary.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Regarding gender diversity, we can see a scenario of the predominance of women (cis or trans) in the community. A problem identified later was that the questions as they were made did not allow us to identify how many trans people were part of the community. Therefore, we do not have disaggregated data on transgender people in the community, and this specific question should be incorporated into future surveys.</p>
</section>
<section id="racial-diversity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="racial-diversity">Racial Diversity</h3>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-06-05-increasing-diversity-sao-paulo/2020-race.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Bar chart where the X axis shows the percentage of respondents of the survey, and the Y axis represents the color/race. Around 73% of the respondents said that they are White; around 14% said they are Brown (black with light skin); around 9% said that they are Black, and around 4% saind they are Yellow (asian descendants).</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Regarding racial diversity in the community in 2020, it is important to highlight that 73.3% of the respondents identified themselves as White, despite the fact that this group represents about half of the population in this region of Brazil. This means that there is an underrepresentation of Black people in the R-Ladies São Paulo community, and we need to take serious actions for ethnic-racial inclusion.</p>
<p>It is also important to mention the <a href="https://www.rladies.org/news/2020-06-06-blm/">text written by the R-Ladies Global and R Forwards team about #BlackLivesMatter in 2020</a>. In this text, that was <a href="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2020-06-rladies-global-blm/">translated into Portuguese by the R-Ladies São Paulo and that is on the community’s blog</a>, R-Ladies Global committed to improving the way the organization supports Black, Indigenous, and other non-white groups:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>“While the R-Ladies mission is focused on improving gender diversity within the R community, we also recognize both the struggle that Black people face, and the compound effect of intersectionality when a member identifies with multiple underrepresented groups. […] We commit to making our community spaces places of not only safety for all our members, but of active work towards equity and justice.”</em> Source: <a href="https://www.rladies.org/news/2020-06-06-blm/">R-Ladies Global Blog</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the questionnaire, we left an open question so that people could make suggestions to increase ethnic-racial diversity in the community, and below are some suggestions received:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Publicize R-Ladies in groups that address racial issues;</p></li>
<li><p>Create quotas for the participation of Black people;</p></li>
<li><p>Invite Black people to speak;</p></li>
<li><p>Publish group statistics on this representation gap;</p></li>
<li><p>Promote events focused on the theme of race;</p></li>
<li><p>Hold events in peripheral regions;</p></li>
<li><p>Promote events focused on Black people;</p></li>
<li><p>Have Black people in the organization of the community.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="inclusion-of-mothersfatherscaregivers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inclusion-of-mothersfatherscaregivers">Inclusion of mothers/fathers/caregivers</h3>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Bar chart where the X axis shows the percentage of respondents of the survey, and the Y axis represents if the person is a mother/father/caregiver. Around 87% of the respondents said YES and 13% said NO.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In 2020, 13% of the respondents had children. Similar to what was done with race, an open question was left and some of the suggestions received for including more people with children were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Providing a space to leave children during events;</p></li>
<li><p>Recording events so that mothers/fathers/caregivers can watch when it is more convenient;</p></li>
<li><p>Conducting online broadcasts of events to promote the participation of people who cannot attend in person.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="inclusion-of-lgbtqia" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inclusion-of-lgbtqia">Inclusion of LGBTQIA+</h3>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-06-05-increasing-diversity-sao-paulo/2020-LGBTQIA.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">Bar chart where the X axis shows the percentage of respondents of the survey, and the Y axis represents if the person is part of the LGBTQIA+ community. Around 70% of the respondents said NO and 30% said YES.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In 2020, 30% of respondents were part of the LGBTQIA+ community. Although there are no data on the percentage of the Brazilian population that is part of the LGBTQIA+ community, the results of this survey indicate that the community is on the right path regarding LGBTQIA+ population inclusion.</p>
<p>Among the suggestions offered by the community to increase the participation of LGBTQIA+, the issue of the community’s name stands out. Some respondents pointed out that the name “R-Ladies” suggests that the group is only for women and discourages people from other groups from participating because it is not clear that they are welcome.</p>

<section id="geographic-regions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geographic-regions">Geographic Regions</h3>
<p>The following map shows the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (the largest polygon), and the City of São Paulo (divided by regions). Most of the people who participate in the event are from the West and South regions of the city. To increase the participation of people from the East and North regions of the city, it is interesting to hold events there.</p>

<section id="actions-taken-to-increase-diversity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="actions-taken-to-increase-diversity">Actions taken to increase diversity</h2>
<p>The questionnaire conducted in 2020, and the discussions established above, point to the need for a collective effort by the community to increase diversity.</p>
<p>In order to achieve that, some actions have been taken and will be briefly commented on below. In posts related to recent events, the activities were described in greater detail, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-03-evento-open-data-day/english.html">Event: Open Data Analysis with R</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://rladies-sp.org/posts/2023-01-evento-oficina-intro-R/">Event: Introduction to R Workshop</a></p></li>

</div>
<section id="affirmative-actions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="affirmative-actions"><strong>Affirmative actions</strong></h3>
<p>Seeking a greater diversity of participants in our events, we saved spots focusing on three groups (quotas):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Black, Brown and Indigenous people</p></li>
<li><p>mothers</p></li>
<li><p>women and other gender minorities</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The quotas are also advertised on the community’s social networks (mainly Instagram), in order to make it clear that the presence of these groups is welcome and desired.</p>
</section>
<section id="space-for-children-and-babies" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="space-for-children-and-babies"><strong>Space for children and babies</strong></h3>
<p>GuGuDaDados (free translation GuguDadata) is a collaborative and experimental space that RLadies São Paulo proposes with the aim of keeping children entertained and cared for while their mothers/fathers/caretakers can participate in community activities. The space itself consists of a room next to the room where the R-Ladies’ activities take place, on the same floor, so that all caregivers feel comfortable to leave their children there.</p>
<p>With financial support from other organizations, we hired a primary school teacher to promote recreational activities with the children in the GuGuDaDadosthroughout the activity. The organizers of R-Ladies also take toys, drawings, markers, games and temporary tattoos to entertain and amuse the children.</p>

</section>
<section id="potluck-collaborative-coffee" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="potluck-collaborative-coffee"><strong>Potluck: Collaborative Coffee</strong></h3>
<p>The collaborative coffee is set up with items purchased with the financial support of sponsor organizations, as well as with items brought by participants (a potluck). Thus, people can eat at any time during the event.</p>
<p>This coffee format (available all the time during the event) is very good for three reasons: (i) it is a great opportunity to meet and talk to people in the community; (ii) it welcomes participants who, due to health issues, cannot go many hours without eating; and (iii) it welcomes participants who, due to socio-economic conditions, cannot afford to have a meal during the lunch break.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the R-Ladies community, it is important to provide a minimum level of support to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to enjoy the event experience regardless of whether they have something to eat during the day. In addition, collaborative coffee is also a way to encourage integration among people!</p>
</section>
<section id="transportation-and-meal-assistance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transportation-and-meal-assistance"><strong>Transportation and Meal Assistance</strong></h3>
<p>To allow people with limited financial means to have access to and benefit from the events, an important action is providing transportation and meal assistance. Meal assistance is offered at in-person events that last a whole day. Transportation assistance is offered at all in-person events. A notable point is that many people who request transportation assistance are from cities outside the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, which shows the potential for creating new R-Ladies chapters in these cities.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>R-Ladies São Paulo received a grant from <a href="https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals#Rstats">R Consortium</a></strong>, which allowed the community to offer financial assistance at the events.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="working-in-pairs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-in-pairs"><strong>Working in pairs</strong></h3>
<p>Not all the participants have a laptop to take to the activity. As we hope that everyone can participate regardless of financial condition, in publicizing, we encourage people to participate regardless of being able to bring a computer. So, in cases where someone goes without a laptop, we encourage people to form pairs and work together during the event. This has always worked and ends up stimulating greater proximity and solidarity between people.</p>
</section>
<section id="encourage-carpooling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="encourage-carpooling"><strong>Encourage carpooling</strong></h3>
<p>The city of São Paulo is very large, and depending on where you need to go, it is common to take 2 hours (or more!) in public transport to move around. Therefore, urban mobility is one of the difficulties to take part of in a in-person event. To overcome this issue, we encourage participantsthat are driving, at the end of the event, to offer rides to people who live in nearby regions of the city. It is still necessary to improve this incentive to combine, in a safe way for all people, rides before the event (and not just at the end).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the survey answers and the community experience over time, these are some of the next steps that we plan to do (or continue doing) in order to increase diversity in our community:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Encourage greater participation of people who belong to any social minority through quotas, an internal stance of positive discrimination; including these people in the organization; inviting them to offer lectures/workshops; promoting visibility; and giving space for these individuals to bring their perspective, experience, and perception to the ongoing structuring of the R-Ladies São Paulo community.</p></li>
<li><p>Search for partnerships in peripheral regions to be able to hold events in those areas, making it easier for people who live far from the city center to attend.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="current-organizing-team" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-organizing-team"><strong>Current organizing team</strong></h2>
<p>There are several people currently involved in the organization of the R-Ladies São Paulo community. It is important to mention that the community organizers belong to different minority groups (such as Black women, mothers, trans people, non-binary people, LGBTQIA+, neurodivergent people, and people over 40 years), and this is important to offer different perspectives and experiences. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the participation in the organization is voluntary. Therefore, we list and thank the people who are involved in the various stages of organizing the community:</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ <section id="introduction" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>R-Ladies São Paulo organized, on March 18, 2023, the event “Open Data Analysis with R - Open Data Day.” The activity took place on a Saturday, during the morning and afternoon, with 6 hours of activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.insper.edu.br/">Insper</a>, a non-profit institution dedicated to teaching and research, once again supported the group by providing the space for the event. Another support received was from <a href="https://curso-r.com/">Curso-R</a>, which provided two teaching assistants to help out participants. The main objective of this event was to offer information about what open data is and its importance. Also, we aimed to promote the opportunity to do a “hands-on” activity exploring open data and tracking the current scenario of public data access at various levels of government and topics.</p>

<p>Open Data Day is an annual celebration of open data worldwide, organized and supported by the Open Knowledge Foundation. If you want to know more, check the official <a href="https://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day website</a> and the project page on the <a href="https://ok.org.br/projetos/open-data-day/">Open Knowledge Brasil website</a>.</p>
</section><section id="main-activity" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-activity"><strong>Main activity</strong></h2>
<p>With about 40 people, we structured the event in four blocks. The first block was instructive and featured a sequence of brief <a href="https://r-ladies-sao-paulo.github.io/2023-03-open-data-day/slides.html">presentations</a> such as: what is the R-Ladies São Paulo community, what is Open Data Day and what is Open Data.</p>

<p>The objective was to make people feel free to work with open data, so we split the class into small working groups. Each group worked on a specific dataset and worked with a Teaching Assistant with experience analyzing that dataset, who guided the group to look into the data and understand them. So, the second block consisted of the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The explanation of how this activity would happen;</p></li>
<li><p>A brief speech (about 5 minutes) by each Teaching Assistant on the topic of their expertise and on the dataset that the group would work on, to facilitate the identification of participants with the subject;</p></li>
<li><p>And the separation of participants into groups according to the affinity of interests - everyone could choose the topic with more interest, and there was no need to resize or redistribute groups.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The topics and respective teaching assistants were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data on violence - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandafielperes/">Fernanda Peres</a>, biomedical</p></li>
<li><p>Environmental data on fires - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmuniz/">Bianca Muniz</a>, journalist</p></li>
<li><p>Educational data - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anacarolinamoreno/">Ana Carolina Moreno</a>, journalist</p></li>
<li><p>Employment data - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprocha/">Ana Paula Rocha</a>, economist</p></li>
<li><p>Election data - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceciliadolago/">Cecília do Lago</a>, journalist</p></li>
<li><p>Prison data - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thandara-santos-348b18122/">Thandara Santos</a>, sociologist</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, teaching assistants were available to help with questions about R:</p>

<p>We created a Google Document so the groups could take and share notes.</p>

<p>Then, in the third block, the groups worked on importing, understanding, and starting to explore the open data of their respective themes. As many people pointed out that they had no experience creating data visualizations and were interested in getting started, co-organizer Beatriz Milz gave a short live coding presentation on using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/esquisse/vignettes/get-started.html">Esquisse package to generate data visualizations with ggplot2</a>.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>In the fourth and last block, the groups presented some of their difficulties, lessons learned, and results (some even showed visualizations made!). In addition, interesting presentations reflected the topics addressed in the initial presentations on open data - for example, some groups indicated dealing with an outdated database, others pointed out that data was aggregated and could be made available with a greater level of detail, etc.</p>
<p>The experience was outstanding, and the organizers and participants demonstrated that they enjoyed the activity a lot (especially the children!). Each group had between two to six people in addition to the teaching assistants, which allowed for a more individualized follow-up to answer questions.</p>

<p>Two interesting points to highlight are the collaborative coffee and the Gugudadados Space.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>We made a collaborative coffee with items purchased by the organizing group (with the money received from the scholarship offered by <a href="https://ok.org.br/">OKBR</a>) and food brought by participants. This way, people could get up and get coffee and something to eat at any time during the event. This coffee format (available the entire time of the event) is very good for three reasons: (i) it respects the time of the groups who can take their breaks as the work progresses; (ii) it welcomes participants who, for health reasons, cannot go without eating for many hours and (iii) welcomes participants who, due to socio-economic conditions, are unable to have a meal during their lunch break. Given the nature of the R-Ladies group, it is an important aspect to provide a welcoming environment so that everyone can enjoy the experience of the event regardless of having something to eat throughout the day, in addition to the fact that the collaborative coffee is also a way to encourage integration between people!</p>
</section><section id="gugudadados-space" class="level3"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gugudadados-space"><strong>Gugudadados Space</strong></h3>
<p>We created the Gugudadados Space to facilitate the participation of people responsible for kids and babies (e.g., mothers, fathers, and caregivers). A baby and four children between 7 and 10 years old participated in this event. With the money from the scholarship offered by <a href="https://ok.org.br/">OKBR</a>, it was possible to hire a recreational teacher in the Gugudadados Space (a room next to the event room, on the same floor) throughout the activity. The R-Ladies organizers also took toys, drawings, markers, games, and temporary tattoos to entertain and amuse the children.</p>

<p>This group explored electoral data for the 2022 elections, made available by the TSE. The group wanted to find out how many candidates did not receive one or zero votes in the 2022 election.</p>
<p>The data used can be obtained from the <a href="https://dadosabertos.tse.jus.br/dataset/resultados-2022/resource/40fdcf49-256a-4c81-87cf-711545bd1528">TSE’s Open Data Portal</a>.</p>

<p>This group explored data on fires in INPE’s BDQueimadas system. This system allows anyone to download data for up to one year. The T.A. prepared a<a href="https://r-ladies-sao-paulo.github.io/2023-03-open-data-day/bdqueimadas_opendataday.pdf">presentation about how to download and import this dataset</a>. The group exported data from 2020 to 2022, and the graph below shows the number of fires per month according to the biome where the fires occurred. It is possible to see in the graph that the biomes with the biggest amount of fires are the Amazon and the Cerrado, and they show seasonal patterns. For example, the highest peak of fires in the Amazon, from 2020 to 2022, was the second semester of 2022.</p>

<p>This group explored data from <a href="https://www.gov.br/depen/pt-br/servicos/sisdepen">SISDEPEN - Statistical Data of the Brazilian Penitentiary System</a>. These data come from the <a href="https://www.gov.br/depen/pt-br/servicos/sisdepen/relatorios-e-manuais/bases-de-dados/arquivos/formulario-sobre-informacoes-prisionais.pdf">Prison Information Form</a>, answered electronically every six months by government employees.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties presented by the group is the availability of data to be aggregated by prison unit rather than by individuals, which makes it impossible to do several fundamental analyses on the prison population in Brazil. Another area for improvement is the lack of standardization of the answers presented in the database, which implies low data reliability.</p>

<p>This group explored public data on violence using data from SINAN - Information System for Aggravation of Notifications, filtering occurrences involving only adults and removing self-inflicted violence (for example, suicide). <strong>The group found that the public data on Violence in DataSUS were outdated.</strong> The dataset for 2020 was incomplete, so the group explored data for 2019. The group generated a series of graphs, such as the one below, showing that the largest number of victims are woman. In addition, it is noteworthy that the author of the aggression is most often male (whether the victim is a woman or a man).</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Another thing pointed out by the group is that when the victims were women, the aggressor tended to be someone they knew, such as a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend. On the other hand, among men, the most common aggressor is a stranger.</p>

<p>We want to increase the diversity in the events, so, in this edition, we separated a percentage of spots thinking about three groups:</p>
<p>- BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color)</p>
<p>- mothers;</p>
<p>- women and other gender minorities.</p>
<p>In this event, 54 people signed up, and 37 participated. Below are some graphs showing information about the diversity of the participants.</p>

<p>There is still a lot of work to do to include unrepresented groups at events, but compared to pre-pandemic events, we are making progress. It is essential to expand the publicity for the following events, especially for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color), mothers, and trans and non-binary people. Also, it is important to look for venues to make events in the periphery.</p>
</section><section id="difficulties" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="difficulties"><strong>Difficulties</strong></h2>
<p>The main difficulty in organizing the event was the short time available for publicizing the activity, since the date and place were defined only six days in advance. Despite the available room having a capacity for 100 people, only 40 had enough time to organize themselves and register as participants.</p>
<p>However, the presence of more than 40 people, including people from the organization, was enough to carry out the activity, with the presence of people really interested in the topic.</p>
</section><section id="commentaries" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="commentaries"><strong>Commentaries</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to the description offered by the organization’s team, we would also like to share two commentaries shared by people who participated in the event:</p>
<p><strong>Tatiana Peixoto:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hello, I’m Tatiana, a 42-year-old cis woman, black, environmental engineer, and passionate about studying. I signed up for the event, not only for the training but also for the search for optimism, thus creating strength to enter the professional market again, as I spent a long time in the academic environment. On 18.03.23th, I understood that R-ladies is much more than an introductory programming event. This team brings a new look at programming, removing blockages and obstacles for all those who want to follow a beautiful path in data science. The event is of excellent quality. I felt welcomed, cared for, and very well treated. I would definitely attend other R-ladies events. In addition to all the kindness of the Insper team in receiving us. I hope that R-ladies SP will continue with new events and new projects because, like me, they will make a lot of people happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Juliana Soprani:</strong></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I take this opportunity to reinforce my congratulations on the event! It was really relevant!!! Not only technically, in learning data analysis and the use of R, but also on the issue of welcoming, triggering a sense of belonging to a group or purpose. For someone starting in the data area, or in a career transition, as in my case, it was very important to see so many women from different areas, ages, and backgrounds working with data and R and engaged in expanding access to the tool for minorities. I am grateful for the opportunity and hope to contribute to health data analysis in the future.</p>
<p>Looking forward to upcoming meetings.</p>

<p>It is important to emphasize the importance of&nbsp;<a href="https://ok.org.br/">OKBR</a>&nbsp;’s financial support, which enabled the purchase of items for the coffee break, stickers, and hiring a recreator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rooms offered by Insper were crucial for the event to take place. The building is easily accessible by public transport. The meeting took place in a large space with internet access, tables, comfortable chairs, and easy access to a restaurant for lunch. The toboggan that is part of the building’s facilities is also a success and makes up one of the most joyful experiences for children who stay at Gugudadados.</p>
<p>Curso-R also supported the event, providing two R teachers to assist in the activity and being available to help with questions from the participants.</p>

<p>This was the first time we held an event with the idea of ​​working in “groups”, and it is certainly a format that worked well (the participants indicated that they preferred this way to expository lectures). We intend to organize other events in this format!</p>
<p>The next R-Ladies São Paulo event is scheduled for May, with a theme yet to be defined. If you are interested in participating, we recommend following our social media!</p>
